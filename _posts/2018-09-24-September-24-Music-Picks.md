## Better Now (feat. Wafia) by Louis the Child

Just when I thought I was getting sick of having drops in my pop music, this song comes along and makes me reconsider. Maybe it's because the pre-chorus is just so darn catchy; as soon as Wafia begins singing "It's true love, don't fake it" my head starts bobbing side to side. As the pre-chorus continues the wobbly synths rise, leading into a drop that seems to aschew classical melody.

## Little Things by Allie X

Little Things is one of Allie's best songs. That is actually saying something for an artist with a near perfect catalog of music. While Allie's three other singles from her new album have been enjoyable this was the first I loved. 
The first thing that stands out in this song is the throbbing bass that permeates the song, building to a crescendo in the bridge that is remniscent of the movie Annihalation. The bass rumbles as Allie uses vocal layering to great effect - one side of her almost screaming and the other sounding defeated and melancholy. 

## Eyes a Mess by Broods

What even is this song? Brother/Sister duo have perhaps put out one of the strangest songs in a while. Technically a cover/remix of two Gotye songs (the Somebody That I Used to Know guy) - this has no right to work so well and yet it does. A slow build that switches to a pulsing driving beat around 2 minutes in where the entire song opens up. In the background are these wild 80's funky flourishes that sound like they were taken from the music of an old fighting game. One of their most creative and best works.

## Plum by Troye Sivan
